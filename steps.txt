what is linting??
linting is running a tool that checks the code formatting, errors, typos
Install flake8 package
Run it through Docker Compose
 'docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "flake8"'

For the testing
We are gonna use the Django test suite
setup tests for the Django app
 'docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py test"'


'docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "django-admin startproject app ."'
The above command is to create a Django app using Django on the docker

docker-compose up
the above command is used to start our services
